# Garrets Completion Counter
A simple counter implemented with Express and Mongoose.

I made this counter to solve a problem my educator (Garret) had when trying to monitor task completion of the students.

The count persists in the database (using MLAB) so that the counter holds the total across different users accessing the site.
